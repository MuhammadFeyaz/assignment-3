/**
 * A sequence of objects (elements) of generic type E, where the
 * position of the object in the sequence matters. Elements can be
 * inserted at the end of the list or at a specific position in
 * the list; elements can also be replaced or removed. But, elements
 * of the list cannot be null.
 *
 * Like in arrays, the position of the first element of the list is
 * <code>0</code> and the last element of the list is at position
 * <code>{@link #size()}-1</code>.
 *
 * Note that there is a built-in interface in Java for that purpose:
 * {@link java.util.List} along with many different implementations.
 *
 * This interface is similar to Java's built-in lists. But for
 * simplicity reasons, this interface is not exactly the same and not
 * compatible to Java's built-in interface of lists.
 *
 * And for the purpose of this assignment, we do not use built-in
 * types and methods of Java for now. For later use in projects,
 * however, it is highly recommended to resort to built-in Java
 * types, whenever you can and when there is not a specific and good
 * reason for not using them.
 *
 * Note that in the declarations of the method below,
 * <code>IllegalArgumentExceptions</code> for parameters with
 * annotations <code>@NotNull</code> are not explicitly stated,
 * even though all methods will throw this exception when called
 * with <code>null</code> for these parameters. This is to ensure
 * that the list never contains <code>null</code> elements.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the list's elements
